# 07-flex-layout-2
This is the final project for this section, so it makes me feel
good that I had a fairly easy time figuring it out. With these
seven projects, I really feel like I understand the basics of
flex!
I've got to say, it's really satisfying when I try something out
and it works. That's how I felt working on the sidebar and cards
on this page. Getting them to stretch, and getting the cards to
display properly wasn't too hard thankfully, but it was very
satisfying to refresh the site and see them displaying properly.
